        <h4>This is in BETA. This means we're testing it to see if it gives a better experience of finding quality statements.</h4>
        <p>Some of the latest quality statements may not be available during August. We're aiming to have all of the latest statements in sync with the NICE website by 1st September 2016.
        In the meantime, <a id="old-standards" href="http://www.nice.org.uk/standards-and-indicators/" target="_blank">quality standards on the NICE website have the up-to-date information.
        </a>
        <p>However, please still test this BETA site.  
            <a id="mailfeedback" href="mailto:nice@nice.org.uk">We need your feedback</a> to help us improve it.</p>
